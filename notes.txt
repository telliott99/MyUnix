find accepts *
but must protect from shell's globbing feature??


To page through a big file like /usr/ share/ dict/words, use the command less /usr/ share/ dict/words. When running less, you’ll see the contents of the file one screenful at a time. Press the spacebar to go forward in the file and the b key to skip back one screenful. To quit, type q.


You can also search for text inside less. For example, to search forward for a word, type /word, and to search backward, use ?word. When you find a match, press n to continue searching.

grep ie /usr/share/dict/words | less

What does Apache's mod_cgi.so do?

Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections and other data between hits and access to Apache internals. A more detailed description of what mod_python can do is available in this O'Reilly article.
