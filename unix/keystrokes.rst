Command Line Keystrokes

It can be very handy to remember control key combinations for navigating around on the command-line.

I found ``CTL-A`` to move the cursor to the beginning of the line particularly useful when I had forgotten ``sudo``, before I learned about ``sudo !!``.  

Also useful is ``CTL-K`` to erase from the cursor to the end of the line, in combination with what's below.

From

I learn about Esc + F to go forward and Esc + B to go backwards, one word at a time.  Out of the box, to repeat the command you must release and re-press the Esc key.  However, I learned from a comment here

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81272/is-there-any-way-in-the-os-x-terminal-to-move-the-cursor-word-by-word

that this can be customized.  In Terminal > Preferences > [profile] > Keyboard enable "Use Option as meta key".  Then use Opt-F and Opt-B to skip by words.

I learn ``Alt-B`` and ``Alt-F``.
