I just set up limited Dropbox access in VB/Ubuntu.

Get the Terminal running with CTL-OPT-T and drag its icon to the top of the Dock.

And I figured out how to page up and down:  SHIFT + PAGE UP/DOWN on the keyboard.  Not sure about when keyboard is not attached.

After several times through, I am labeling my snapshots of the server in sync with these chapters.  So at this point I will save one as ``server1``.
